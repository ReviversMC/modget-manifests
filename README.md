# Modget Manifest Repository
This repository contains the manifest files for the **Modget** default source. You are highly encouraged to submit manifests for your favorite mod.
> Note: At this time mods must be .JARs. Standalone executables or compressed .zip files are not currently supported.

[**Modget**](https://github.com/ReviversMC/modget) is an open source Minecraft mod package manager.


# Submitting a Package
To submit a package to this repository, you should follow these steps:
1. Follow the [Contributing](#contributing) guidelines below.
2. [Author](#authoring-a-manifest) a manifest.
3. [Test](#testing-your-manifest) your manifest.
4. [Add](#adding-your-package-to-the-lookup-table) your manifest to the lookup table.
5. [Submit](#submitting-your-pr) your pull request (PR).
6. Respond to any feedback in your PR.

> Note:
> - Only submit mods which are considered stable. This disallows all mods which are marked as `Alpha` on CurseForge/Modrinth and mods, which haven't been published to these platforms yet if the reasoning behind this is that they're too unstable (see C2ME for example).
> - Please check the package's manifest you intend to submit does not already exist in the repository, and there are no open PRs for it in order to avoid duplicates.

## Authoring a Manifest
In the future, you will be able to use the [Modget Manifest Creator](https://github.com/ReviversMC/modget-create). Currently, you have to craft a manifest manually following our [authoring guidelines](AUTHORING_MANIFESTS.md).

> Note: Only one manifest may be submitted per PR.

## Testing your manifest
Now that you have authored your manifest, you should make sure it works as expected. Simply copy your local repository into the `/modget/local_repos/` directory inside your Minecraft directory.

> ‚ùó Note: Modget doesn't support the following commands yet!

1. Verify the syntax by executing the following command:
```
/modget validate <package id> --local
```

2. Test the install by executing the following command:
```
/modget install <package id> --local
```

## Adding your package to the lookup table
With the manifest verified, you have to now add some basic metadata to the [lookup table](./lookup-table.yaml). See the [lookup table spec](./doc/lookup-table-spec-v2.md) on how to do this.

## Submitting your PR
With all of this out of the way, you will finally need to submit a PR. Your manifest should be located in the folder path matching `manifests / <first upper case letter of publisher> / <publisher> / <modid> / publisher.modid.yaml` (see the [YAML file name and folder structure](./doc/manifest-spec-v3.md#yaml-file-name-and-folder-structure)).

### Validation Process
The PR request will go through a validation process. During the process, the core team or (in the future) the Modget bot will use [labels](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/package/winget-validation#pull-request-labels) to help. In the event of a failure, the bot will suggest where the problem is with the submission and assign the PR back to you.

### Respond to PR feedback
If the PR has been assigned to you, a timer is triggered. You will have 7 days to resolve the issue, or the PR will be closed automatically by the bot.

Submissions to the repository are reviewed by Modget administrators and/or moderators.
