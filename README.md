# Modget Manifest Repository
This repository contains the manifest files for the **Modget** default source. You are highly encouraged to submit manifests for your favorite mod.
> Note: At this time mods must be .JARs. Standalone executables or compressed .zip files are not currently supported.

[**Modget**](https://github.com/ReviversMC/modget) is an open source Minecraft mod package manager.


# Submitting a Package
To submit a package to this repository, you should follow these steps:
1. Follow the [Contributing](#contributing) guidelines below.
2. [Author](#authoring-a-manifest) a Manifest.
3. [Test](#testing-your-manifest) your manifest.
4. [Submit](#submitting-your-pr) your pull request (PR).
5. Respond to any feedback in your PR.

> Note: Please check the package's manifest you intend to submit does not already exist in the repository, and there are no open PRs for it in order to avoid duplicates.

## Authoring a Manifest
In the future, you will be able to use the [Modget Manifest Creator](https://github.com/ReviversMC/modget-create). Currently, you have to craft a manifest manually following our [authoring guidelines](AUTHORING_MANIFESTS.md).

> Note: Only one manifest may be submitted per PR.

## Testing your manifest
Now that you have authored your manifest, you should make sure it works as expected.

> ‚ùó Note: Modget doesn't support the following commands yet!

1. Verify the syntax by executing the following command:
```
modget validate <manifest-name>
```

2. Test the install by executing the following command:
```
modget install -m <manifest-name>
```
The manifests have to be located inside the `.minecraft/config/modget/custom-manifests/` folder.

## Submitting your PR
With the manifest verified, you will need to submit a PR. Your manifest should be located in the folder path matching `manifests / <first upper case letter of publisher> / <Publisher> / <ModID> / Publisher.ModID.yaml`

### Validation Process
The PR request will go through a validation process. During the process, the core team or (in the future) the Modget bot will use [labels](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/package/winget-validation#pull-request-labels) to help. In the event of a failure, the bot will suggest where the problem is with the submission and assign the PR back to you.

### Respond to PR feedback
If the PR has been assigned to you, a timer is triggered. You will have 7 days to resolve the issue, or the PR will be closed automatically by the bot.

Submissions to the repository are reviewed by Modget administrators and/or community moderators.
